            <h2>Apple Watch Stress Tracking</h2>
            <h5>by Matthew Nudelman</h5>
            <h6 id="date">Month DD, YYYY</h6>

              <span class="article-text"
                >Thanks to a recent study, it has been found that the heart rate
                sensor of the Apple Watch is capable of being used for tracking
                stress. Currently, Apple does not have any native application
                for stress monitoring on the Apple Watch, so this hardware
                capability is not officially being taken advantage of at this
                time. The Apple Watch already tracks a metric known as heart
                rate variability (HRV), which measures the change in time
                intervals between heartbeats. It is like measuring the
                acceleration of the wearer's heart rate. The variance is very
                small, so it is measured in milliseconds. Studies have shown
                that the Apple Watch is just as reliable as heart rate monitors
                specifically designed for accurate heart rate monitoring. A
                higher HRV is generally healthier as it often means the body
                adapts quickly to different conditions.</span

              <span class="article-text"
                >The Apple Watch has been found to be capable of accurately
                measuring HRV, but it does not interpret the data for users to
                understand what it indicates about their health. This metric is
                valuable for stress tracking as lower HRV likely represents
                greater stress. Precise monitoring is necessary to properly
                interpret this information, and the study has shown that the
                Apple Watch is capable of such precision.</span

              <span class="article-text"
                >Right now, the official Apple Health app on the iPhone of Apple
                Watch users can provide data on the wearer's heart rate
                variability, and can present the user with the trend over the
                past 6 months or year. An upward trend can mean a reduction in
                stress and a downward trend can mean an increase in stress.
                There are also third-party apps such as
                <a
                  href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/training-today/id1507992127"

                  ><u>Training Today</u></a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stress-monitor-for-watch/id1510429086"

                >
                which may be more clear when it comes to interpreting the
                wearer's HRV by providing information for a better understanding
                of what it means for their stress levels.</span

                >The Apple Watch being so capable as a heart rate monitor while
                still being a consumer-friendly device designed for all-around
                users could be very beneficial for its uses in the lives of many
                people.</span
