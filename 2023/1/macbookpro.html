            <h2>New MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and M2 Max Announced</h2>
            <h5>by Matthew Nudelman</h5>
            <h6 id="date">Month DD, YYYY</h6>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="article-text"
                >Just today, Apple announced the new M2 Pro and M2 Max chips for
                the newest Mac and MacBook computers. This continues from Apple
                developing their own silicon for all of their products since the
                M1 was introduced in 2020 and has since been in use in the
                MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Mini, iMac, and eventually even
                the iPad Pro and iPad Air. In 2022, Apple introduced the M2 for
                the first time in the newest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iPad
                Pro. Now, there are two new additions to the M2 lineup with the
                M2 Pro and M2 Max, similar to what was done with the M1 as it
                also had Pro and Max variants. There was also the M1 Ultra, but
                it was only featured in last year's Mac Studio, and as of now
                there has been no new Mac Studio announced, so there is no M2
                Ultra for now.</span

              <span class="article-text"
                >Apple claims that the new MacBook Pro has a battery life of up
                to 22 hours, making it the longest lasting battery of any
                MacBook to date. The new MacBook Pro also supports Wi-Fi 6E, the
                latest standard in Wi-Fi connectivity (which many devices have
                already adopted within the past year). The HDMI port supports 8K
                displays for the first time on the MacBook. The M2 Max even
                comes with up to 96GB of unified memory, far larger than most
                laptops, meaning it is possible to have many demanding programs
                running at the same time and working with projects that are too
                big for many other computers.</span

                >As is common with Apple's own hardware, the company boasts
                their product's power efficiency since they are able to optimize
                it much more effectively when they are designing the processors
                and software themselves. They claim the M2 Pro, featuring
                configurations for a CPU with either 10 cores or 12 cores, will
                provide up to 20 percent greater performance than the M1 Pro.
                They also say the GPU will deliver up to 30 percent better
                graphics performance and that the “Neural Engine” is 40 percent
                faster, speeding up processes that use AI. Apple also continues
                to compare their own silicon to the past Intel-based MacBooks,
                claiming that the M2 Pro and M2 Max make the MacBook much more
                powerful and efficient. For example, they say that image
                processing in Adobe Photoshop is up to 80 percent faster with
                the M2 Pro compared to the “fastest Intel-based MacBook Pro.”
                The M2 Max has a GPU with up to 38 cores and a CPU with 12
                cores.</span

              <span class="article-text"
                >The HDMI connectivity has been expanded to 8K displays, though
                the refresh rate can only reach up to 60Hz, while it can go up
                to 240Hz with a 4K display. Apple also continues to keep ports
                limited as they only provide three USB-C ports on the MacBook
                Pro and very likely are never planning to include an USB-A port
                on any MacBook at any point. The transition to USB-C has been
                less-than-smooth for Apple as they initially rushed into it back
                in 2015 with the “new MacBook” featuring a single USB-C port and
                nothing else, and the 2018 MacBook Air which dropped everything
                for two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. However, now that
                USB-C has been much more widely adopted, this will likely become
                less of an issue in the future. Despite the internal differences
                of the new MacBook Pro, the exterior is actually identical to
                the M1 MacBook Pro, so the amount of ports has not been changed
                since then.</span

                of performance tests users may put it through in order to see
                how much more powerful it really may be.</span
