            <h2>Samsung Galaxy Unpacked to Reveal Galaxy S23 Phones Today</h2>
            <h5>by Matthew Nudelman</h5>
            <h6 id="date">Month DD, YYYY</h6>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="article-text"
                >Today, Samsung is set to hold its annual Samsung Unpacked event
                to present their newest Galaxy S phones, the Samsung Galaxy S23
                series. A little bit of information on the phones has already
                come out, though some of it has yet to be officially confirmed.
                This includes information about the three different models that
                will be featured, following Samsung's trend of having three
                models: a normal phone, a “plus” phone, and their flagship
                “ultra” phone. Similar to Google, Samsung is not expected to
                drastically change the design of their phones this year, as they
                seem to have found their current identity in the look and feel
                of the Galaxy S22 phones just as Google did with the Pixel 6
                phones.</span
              >
              <br />
              <span class="article-text"
                >The event will begin at 1:00 pm EST today, February 1, and is
                expected to showcase a couple of different things, specifically
                the Galaxy S23 phones and a new Galaxy Book.</span
              >
              <br />
              <span class="article-text"
                >The Samsung Galaxy S23 is expected to have a near-identical
                appearance to the S22, though many rumors strongly suggest that
                the rear camera corner will no longer have a raised edge as the
                S21 and S22 did, following in the footsteps of the Galaxy S22
                Ultra and unifying the looks of the phones across the board. The
                cameras themselves are said to be the same, a 50MP primary
                sensor with a 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephoto. The display
                will also be the same, a 6.1-inch FHD+ screen, which is
                definitely no disappointment as Samsung is a prolific provider
                of high-quality display panels even to their competitors
                (including Apple, whose iPhones use Samsung displays). The
                cameras in the S23+ will be the same as the S23, so they are not
                going to be different either. The main upgrade the phones are
                expected to have is in the processor, as it is believed that
                both the S23 and S23+ will be using the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2,
                not just in certain regions, but everywhere in the world. This
                would be unexpected as Samsung typically uses their own Exynos
                chips for certain regions, usually leading to backlash as the
                Exynos phones tend to be significantly underpowered despite the
                pricing being relatively the same as the Snapdragon phones. This
                upgrade to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 would be very significant,
                especially in regions that normally get stuck with Exynos
                phones. However, the overall price of the S23 series is expected
                to increase, though a similar rumor surrounding the price of the
                iPhone 14 was eventually proven to be untrue at the September
                2022 Apple Event. As expected, the Galaxy S23 Ultra is the
                biggest point of interest, with its expected 200MP main sensor
                to replace the 108MP sensor of the camera system of the
                highly-praised S22 Ultra. The S-Pen is also expected to stay as
                the S23 Ultra is said to be moving forward with the Ultra
                redesign of 2022. The device will potentially have slightly less
                rounded edges to make holding the phone and using the S-Pen more
                comfortable.</span

                10am PST today, Feb 1, 2023, and it will definitely be
                interesting to see what sorts of changes may be made to
                Samsung's main series of smartphones.
