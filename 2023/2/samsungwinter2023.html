As expected, the Galaxy S23 phones were shown off with many similarities to the S22 phones, with the appearance of the cameras on all three phones being the same as on the S22 Ultra. The processor was also upgraded to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, though Samsung claims it is a version specifically designed for Galaxy devices. The S23 and S23+ have the same rear cameras as last year's phones, but the front-facing camera of the S23+ and S23 Ultra has actually been reduced to 12MP, similar to the front camera of Apple's iPhone. The Galaxy S22+ and Galaxy S22 Ultra had a 40MP front camera for shooting 4-in-1 binned photos. Other than that, the S23 and S23+ cameras are the same as last year's with a 50MP wide sensor, a 12MP ultrawide sensor, and a 10MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom.</span> <br /> <img class="article-img" src="https://images.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s23/images/galaxy-s23-share-image.jpg" title="The Samsung Galaxy S23 and S23+." alt="Samsung Galaxy S23 and S23 Plus."/> <br> <span class="article-text">The main event, once again, was the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Samsung spent a considerable amount of time on the new 200MP camera sensor that they showed off as the ISOCELL HP2 earlier on. The S Pen remains in the Ultra, showing that the Ultra phones truly are the successor to the Galaxy Note phones that were discontinued after the Galaxy Note 20 in 2020. Samsung also claims that low-light and night time photography and video have been improved. Samsung says the Galaxy S23 Ultra is great for astrophotography, true to its Galaxy name. The webpage for the S23 Ultra also states that the battery is the same 5000mAh battery as in the S22 Ultra, but that it is more efficient than last year's phone due to “improved processing power.”

The pricing of the S23 starts at $799, the S23+ starts at $999, and the S23 Ultra starts at $1199. This means the base model's price increased by $50, the Plus model's price increased by $100, and the Ultra model's price increased by $150, and the rumors of an increased price were true. It is exciting to see what people will think once the phones are in the hands of consumers.
