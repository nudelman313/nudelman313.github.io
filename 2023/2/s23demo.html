None of my use was extensive or particular due to limitations of in-store demo hardware, but I wanted to share my initial thoughts on the devices regardless of this.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">My first impression of all of them is that they look very nice. Samsung has spent years refining the look and feel of their phones so it is no surprise that their most recent devices, though incredibly similar to last year's, have a very polished look to them. They also feel great in the hand, with comfortably-shaped edges that are flat but not too sharp, giving them a premium feel. The look of the cameras on the back was an interesting change as the stand-out corner from 2021 and 2022 was much more recognizable, but the separated camera bumps don't look half-bad either. They looked good on the S22 Ultra last year, so it is nice to see the design become more unified across the board. The S23 in particular is the perfect size for a “mid-size phone” (by today's standards of massive screens with small bezels). It didn't feel big in my hand, but the screen looks great and I don't think it would ever truly become too cramped for me to use. The S23+ was surprisingly comfortable as well, and this is coming from someone who tends to prefer the smaller to medium sized phones. The screen looks good as expected and the device feels just as good as the smaller S23.</span> <br /><img class="article-img "src="/img/s23ultracolors.png" alt="The Galaxy S23 Ultra." title="Galaxy S23 Ultra color options."><br><span class="article-text">The devices run Android 13 with One UI 5.0, which is my favorite Android skin both visually and functionally. Google's Pixel UI saw some changes with Android 12 that made me less of a fan of the Pixel software, which is a shame due to the otherwise incredible rebound that Google has made with getting people to care about the Pixel and finding their own identity with the Pixel 6. On the other hand, Samsung only continues to improve their software. From the rocky years of TouchWiz, the period of denial with “Grace UX”, and the confusing stages of Samsung Experience, One UI combines the best of it all without much bloat. It works great with the hardware and the new update with lock screen customization is nice to see (though Apple somehow beat Samsung to the punch this time around?!). Of course, no software is good without good hardware to run it, and Samsung has once again created a solid flagship device this year.
</span><br><img class="article-img "src="/img/One_UI_5.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S23 with One UI 5.0 on Android 13." title="The Galaxy S23 with One UI 5.0 on Android 13."> <br /><span class="article-text">The Galaxy S23 Ultra is the best of the S22 Ultra, with a few bonuses. I love how it feels to hold. In retrospect, the edges of the S22 Ultra were far too round. The S23 Ultra shows that Samsung recognizes this and so the edges are flatter, with slightly-rounded corners to keep it from stabbing the hands. This feels way nicer, and makes drawing with the S Pen much more comfortable. On the topic of the S Pen, it functions just as expected. The S22 Ultra already made fantastic use of the S Pen, and the S23 Ultra works just as well with it. I also tried out the new camera, and my pictures of the table the phone sat on looked pretty good. I did try the front camera as well, which looked just fine. I actually used the 100x zoom as well to see how it worked, and viewing a photo immediately after it was taken showed the processing at work. It took a second or two to display the final version of the picture, and it looked as good as a picture of the “LG” sign at the TV section would look if you tried taking a picture from several yards away and zoomed in to just the letters. But with the Galaxy S23 Ultra, that's not terrible! Samsung has never been at the top of smartphone camera software, but what they offer this year is solid and works as well as you would need it to if you were buying this phone. Speaking of which, I really do wish I had this phone! I have very little to criticize, with the only thing that isn't perfect being recording video (something very few Android devices seem to be as good at as Apple devices, for some reason). Other than that, the Galaxy S23 Ultra appears to be a very good device that I would absolutely use daily. Unfortunately, this is a flagship phone and I don't have flagship money.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">In the end, it is up to you to decide if you even like these phones at all. I just like to talk about these things, so this has been my impressions and thoughts on the Samsung Galaxy S23 phones. Maybe someday in the future, when the S23 has become obsolete and the S27 reigns supreme, I'll have my very own S23 Ultra to use as much as I want. Until then, I'll keep appreciating new devices from the sidelines.</span> <br /></p> </article> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <div class="directory" id="monthbox"> <h4>Directory</h4> <script>monthBox();</script> </div> <div class="directory" id="tagbox"> <script>tagList();</script> </div> <div class="directory references"> <h4>References</h4> <ol><li id="cite-note-1"> Me </li></li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> </div> </div> <hr /> <script>dateFill(8);</script> </body> </html>
