As the years passed, the project seemed to develop, and much more information has been discovered within the past couple of years. This year, reports claimed Apple was initially going to reveal the mixed-reality headset in the spring, but production was reportedly delayed by a couple of months as a result of several factors, including the device itself being ready for consumers.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">Currently, it is believed that the headset will be officially announced at WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) this June 5th, as Apple was in the process of addressing issues with the hardware and software earlier this year. The headset is now believed to be in the final stages of development, and is set to appear at the conference. There are also claims that Apple is already working on next-generation versions of the device for 2025 with lower and higher-end versions. Reports claim this device will be priced at $3,000, with Apple intending to aim it towards developers, rather than their usual iPhone market. They project sales of “almost one million,” expecting to sell close to 900,000 units. Former Apple executive Michael Gartenberg believes it could end up being one of the “great tech flops of all time,” and many people within Apple share this sentiment. Internally, there has been much disagreement on whether the device will be worth it, with many believing it will be a disaster and that it is very “un-Apple-like.” On the other hand, the founder of Oculus claimed that it is “so good,” implying there are people testing it currently.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">The leaked name of the operating system, “xrOS,” is referenced in the code of the new “Apple Devices” app for Windows, as well as the name “Reality,” hinting towards the rumored possibility of the headset’s name being along the lines of “Apple Reality.” It is said that the headset will support all first-party iPad apps, and that third-party apps would be compatible without much complication or extra effort from developers. It is said that there will be a dial allowing for easy transitioning between AR and VR modes. It has also been said that there will be gesture controls that can detect detailed changes in position of the hands, as well as objects and people in front of the user. One rumored feature even includes a virtual keyboard that a user could type on in front of them as if it is really there, though this remains to be seen.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">The headset may apparently come with a charger equivalent to that of a MacBook, and possibly an external battery pack to keep the headset running. The idea is that it will be connected by a cable and kept in the user’s pocket to avoid adding extra weight to the headset itself. It is believed that the headset will have multiple processors as well, with the main one being on the level of the M2 chip released for new Mac devices last year.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">There is much that is unclear about exactly what this headset will be like, as most of the information up to this point is coming from sources that have yet to be verified.</span> <br /></p> </article> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <div class="directory" id="monthbox"> <h4>Directory</h4> <script>monthBox();</script> </div> <div class="directory" id="tagbox"> <script>tagList();</script> </div> <div class="directory references"> <h4>References</h4> <ol><li id="cite-note-1"> <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks" target="_blank">Tom's Guide</a> </li></li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> </div> </div> <hr /> <script>dateFill(15);</script> </body> </html>
