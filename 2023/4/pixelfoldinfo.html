It is clear that one of these stands above the rest, as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold has had four versions with a fifth on the way, and is often considered the closest any company has gotten to proving the value of a foldable phone. However, another big name is soon to debut a folding phone to call its own, as Google plans to unveil one in the form of the Pixel Fold this May at its annual “Google I/O” developer conference alongside the expected Pixel 7a.</span> <br /><img class="article-img" src="/img/Google-Pixel-7-7-Pro-Review-Gear.png" title="Google Pixel 7." alt="Google Pixel 7."/> <br><span class="article-text">According to internal documents, which call it by the codename “Felix,” Google claims the Pixel Fold has “the most durable hinge on a foldable” phone, and Google most likely aims to compete directly with Samsung with this claim as while Samsung managed to execute the folding phone first, it has been difficult to avoid the eventual crease that forms from repeated folding of the phone, which does not take long when the main draw of the phone is the ability to fold it in half. Samsung also prices its Galaxy Z Fold 4 at $1799, a price Google is rumored to challenge by pricing its Pixel Fold at $1700, a whole $99 less. 
</span> <br /><span class="article-text">The Google Pixel Fold is expected to be water-resistant and have a 5.8-inch outer screen. The inner screen supposedly unfolds to the same 7.6-inch size as the screen on Samsung’s competing phone, and the device is slightly heavier than Samsung’s as well, at 10 ounces. This may be due to the larger battery, which is said to last up to 24 hours normally, or up to 72 hours in battery saver mode. The processor is expected to be the same Google-made Tensor G2 used in the Pixel 7, allowing it to utilize all software features Google has developed exclusively for devices with Tensor processors.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">The Google Pixel Fold will be Google’s opportunity to show that they are truly taking their competition seriously, and are now confident enough in the Pixel that they are willing to make a device directly competing with the juggernaut in the Android phone market that Samsung is. It will be exciting to see what a purely Google foldable phone experience could be like, as there will likely be many unique software features for the phone. More information will surely become available within the next couple of weeks, as many look forward to the event on May 10.</span> <br /></p> </article> </div> <div class="col-md-2"> <div class="directory" id="monthbox"> <h4>Directory</h4> <script>monthBox();</script> </div> <div class="directory" id="tagbox"> <script>tagList();</script> </div> <div class="directory references"> <h4>References</h4> <ol><li id="cite-note-1"> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/google-pixel-fold-release-date.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a> </li></li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div class="row"> </div> </div> <hr /> <script>dateFill(11);</script> </body> </html>
