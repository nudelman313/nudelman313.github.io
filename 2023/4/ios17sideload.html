Sideloading apps is an option Android users have enjoyed practically since the beginning, only needing to check off a box in settings allowing them to install apps from “unknown sources” outside of the Google Play Store, giving them the option to install the application package directly from their phone. Soon, with new regulations set by the European Union, all devices will have to allow users to install apps from anywhere, rather than being restricted to a single app store.</span> <br /><img class="article-img" src="\img\Apple-App-Store.jpg" title="The App Store" alt="Apple App Store"/> <br><span class="article-text">Apple has been against sideloading for a long time, citing potential security risks while also likely wanting to avoid losing out on the fee developers have to pay them for the privilege of making an app for iOS. Apple also likely fears the possible damage to their reputation for keeping their software experience clean that could occur if someone were to accidentally install malicious software on their iPhone, and they have been resistant to giving that up. Now, while Apple is likely to be stubborn about this just as they are rumored to be with USB-C on the iPhone 15, they will still be required to allow it.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">Apple has long treated development for its platforms as a privilege, and is strict when it comes to what is allowed on the App Store, so this will be a major change when it does eventually happen, allowing developers to create applications for devices that anyone will have the freedom to install, without needing Apple’s express approval. Sideloading support will also allow access to other app stores, meaning developers of apps such as emulators, which are not allowed on the App Store, can provide easy access to their software without requiring the device to be jailbroken. Jailbreaking is the act of freeing a device from software restrictions put in place by the original manufacturer, a practice that has become less popular as restrictions are becoming harder to crack. However, it may become much less necessary when sideloading is officially allowed, as jailbroken devices used to be the only ones that could easily do this.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">However, an unexpected side-effect of this news has resulted from Apple’s iconic restrictions being something many users of their devices seem to consider a selling point of the products. It is unclear whether this is related to the “premium” feeling that Apple typically gives their devices being associated with everything about them, including the things that are restrictive. It may be possible that users are disappointed about the idea that the software they are familiar with will soon be comparable to one they are less accustomed to and possibly view as inferior, but this is just speculation.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">It is surprising that the “Apple vs. Android” debate rages on after all these years, as it seems more reasonable to accept that they are different products for different people, each with things that each person may prefer over the others. Regardless, many are unhappy with the announcement that iOS will allow sideloading, for reasons that are not clear. This is an optional feature, so for someone who is against the change, the only thing that needs to change for them is nothing at all, so it is not something to be concerned about.</span> <br /><span class="article-text">Regardless of what any individual person prefers, the ability to sideload apps on iOS will inevitably become available at some point this year. It has a high likelihood of exclusivity to regions where it is legally required, but either way, this change will surely be an impactful one on software development for Apple devices.
