Wow! The month of November! Many may find solace in the knowledge that we are currently within the penultimate month of the year! Though, one might ask why November is the eleventh month. Does "nove" not create the expectation that this month is associated with the number "nine"? Indeed, for November was once the ninth month, out of ten in total. Strange as it may be, the final four months of the year are named by number. Julius Caesar changed it all up for no reason and now everyone's paying for it and the names no longer make sense! However, things could have turned out much worse than this. He could have placed July and August at the end of the year. Could you imagine Winter in August? That would be something!
