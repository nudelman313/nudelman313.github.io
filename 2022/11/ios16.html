                The latest stable release of Apple's iOS 16 was made available
                in October, but the next update, iOS 16.2, has already become
                available as beta software for developers. iOS 16 was first
                introduced in September, featuring additions to the iPhone<a
                  href="#cite-note-1"
                  ><sup onclick="hCite(1,2)">[1]</sup></a
                >
                software such as lock screen-specific customization features
                which most notably allow users to add widgets to their lock
                screen. They also include options to change the font and color
                of the clock, as well as changes to the way things such as the
                timer and music player are handled.

                class="article-img"
                src="../../img/ios15v16timer.png"
                title="iOS 15 places the timer in small text under the clock, while iOS 16 features it as part of the notifications."
                alt="A comparison between the lock screen timer in iOS 15 and iOS 16. iOS 15 places the timer in small text under the clock, while iOS 16 features it as part of the notifications."
              /><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Returning to the music player for the first time since iOS 10 is
                the option to have album art fill the entire lock screen, rather
                than just appearing as a small image in the player. This option
                may appear automatically, so users who dislike the feature may
                disable it by tapping on the album art. </span
              ><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Notifications have also been updated as they now default to
                staying stacked towards the bottom of the screen, though users
                still have the option to go back to the original list layout if
                preferred. </span
              ><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Changes to iMessage include the ability to quickly edit a
                message or unsend it, though this will only work properly when
                messaging others who also have iOS 16 installed. If a user with
                iOS 16 attempts to edit a message they sent to a user with iOS
                15 or lower, or a friend with a phone running Android, the
                edited message will instead be sent below the original message.
                Don't count on the feature if you aren't sure which version your
                friend has! Similarly, the "unsend" feature will not have any
                effect. </span
              ><br />
              <img
                class="article-img"
                src="../../img/ios16editmessage.png"
                title="iOS 16 features the ability to edit messages sent with iMessage."
                alt="An image of a text message sent with iMessage being edited with the new message-editing feature introduced in iOS 16."
              /><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Apple introduces its own feature akin to the Magic Eraser found
                on Google's Pixel 6 and 7 devices in the form of a new option to
                lift a subject in a photo from the background using AI. Because
                of the extra processing power needed, this feature is not
                available on Apple devices with a chipset older than the A12
                Bionic. The same applies to Live Text, introduced with iOS 15,
                which recognizes words from an image. Android users have enjoyed
                such a feature since 2017 thanks to Google Lens, which attempts
                to recognize text in images as well. This feature is also
                available in the Google app found on the App Store, but now iOS
                users will have this type of feature built into the software on
                their phone as well. Starting with iOS 16, Live Text works on
                paused videos as well, negating the need to take a screenshot.
                Live Text can also do much more than simply copy text, as users
                can now use it to instantly call phone numbers, convert the
                currency on a price tag, translate languages, scan QR codes, and
                more. Again, Google Lens is capable of these things as well, so
                users of Android devices will not have to worry about missing
                out. </span
              ><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Since the first release of iOS 16, updates<a href="#cite-note-2"
                  ><sup onclick="hCite(2,2)">[2]</sup></a
                >
                have been in the works to finish adding previously-announced
                features for the software, including shared iCloud Photo
                libraries, and enabling support for the Live Activities API.
                Live Activities take advantage of the updated lock screen by
                allowing apps to push information in a timely manner for
                activities such as workouts. These features are now available as
                of iOS 16.1, released on October 24th. This update also brings
                an improvement to battery icon in the status bar, as the
                percentage, which was finally made visible on iPhones with the
                notch thanks to iOS 16, as the battery level now has a visual
                indicator which scales with the percentage and changes color
                much like the original battery indicator on older iPhones. </span
              ><br />
              <img
                class="article-img"
                src="../../img/ios16battery.png"
                title="iOS 16.1 updates the look of the status bar battery icon for improved visual clarity, as iOS 16 first made the percentage visible on newer iPhones."
                alt="An image of the battery icon on the iPhone status bar. The battery percentage is visible on top of the battery, a first for new iPhones with Face ID. iOS 16.1 adds the visual indicator for battery level back to the icon."
              /><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Now, iOS 16.2 has been released through the Apple Beta Software
                Program. It features support for Live Activities with sports
                scores through Apple TV, and introduces the previously-announced
                Freeform app, a canvas that can be used for collaborating with
                others on projects. Apple continues to update iOS 16 to include
                everything that has been announced for it, and users can expect
                the stable release of iOS 16.2 at some point before the end of
                this year.
