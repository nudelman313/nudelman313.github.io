                >This fall, Google joined the smartwatch game with the Pixel
                Watch. This is coming after Google finally found its place in
                the smartphone market with the Pixel 6, featuring Google's own
                Tensor chip and unique design, and then continued down this path
                with the Pixel 7 in October. Google has been trying to solidify
                its Pixel brand to properly make themselves the “Apple of
                Android,” developing both the hardware and software themselves
                in order to create the most seamless Android experience
                possible. Since they joined in on the wireless earbud craze back
                in 2017 with the Pixel Buds, Google continues to expand its
                Pixel hardware lineup in order to properly compete with Samsung
                and Apple, companies which already have their own wearable
                products in the form of the Galaxy Watch and Buds, and the Apple
                Watch and AirPods. Google also revealed more details about the
                upcoming Pixel Tablet, which aims to function as both a standard
                tablet and, with the dock, as a smart home display much like the
                Amazon Echo Show and Google's own Nest Hub.</span

                src="/img/pixelwatchwide.jpg"
                title="The Google Pixel Watch."
                alt="The Google Pixel Watch has a circular deisgn with a glass dome front."
              />
              <br />
              <span class="article-text"
                >The Pixel Watch has a circular design and is both
                water-resistant and scratch-resistant. It has a knob for
                scrolling and a side button for opening recently-used apps. The
                way different bands are attached is unique as bands can easily
                be snapped on and off. The Pixel Watch runs Wear OS 3.5, the
                latest release of Wear OS, a version of Android designed
                specifically for smartwatches. Samsung's Galaxy Watch has been
                using this, and now Google has made their own watch for it. It
                works with Google Home to quickly adjust smart home devices such
                as adjusting the thermostat and turning off the lights. It also
                works with Google Assistant, Google's own voice assistant, so
                users can easily give voice commands directly to the watch. Like
                most smartwatches, users can check notifications, get directions
                with Google Maps, make payments with NFC, and listen to
                music.</span

              <br />
              <span class="article-text"
                >Another common smartwatch feature present on the Pixel Watch is
                the fitness software, which uses Fitbit to essentially make the
                Pixel Watch function like a souped-up Fitbit device. It uses an
                optical heart rate sensor and on-device machine learning to
                provide an accurate heart rate measurement every second.
                However, updating the heart rate measurement this frequently can
                take a lot out of the already-short battery life of this device.
                It charges quickly, but using it as a sleep monitor may require
                a fully-charged battery at night that will need to be recharged
                immediately in the morning. Users and reviewers have reported
                rapidly-decreasing battery life that is difficult to compare to
                the battery life of the much more established Galaxy Watch and
                Apple Watch, smartwatches which have had much more time to
                perfect and optimize power consumption.</span

              <span class="article-text"
                >Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, and now seems to be taking
                advantage of their ownership of the brand and using Fitbit's
                capabilities to provide fitness features to their own brand of
                wearable devices. It includes 40 different exercise modes and
                works with the GPS in the watch for tracking distance. However,
                strangely, the Fitbit functionality does not seem to have any
                connection to Google Fit, despite both being considered Google
                services to achieve the same things. Initially, Google Fit could
                not even be downloaded on the Pixel Watch at all, though this
                has since been corrected. However, this heavy emphasis on the
                Fitbit branding leaves many wondering if Google Fit will
                eventually be absorbed into the Fitbit platform, replacing the
                Google-branded fitness software with the much-more-popular
                Fitbit name.</span
              >
              <br />
              <span class="article-text"
                >Google Pixel users will be pleased to know that Android's
                convenient Fast Pair feature works with the Watch just like the
                Buds. Bring a brand new Pixel Watch next to your Android phone
                running Android 8.0 or newer and you will instantly be prompted
                to pair the devices and set up your new smartwatch. Anyone
                familiar with Apple's AirPods or Apple Watch may recognize this,
                as the iPhone can be quickly paired to those devices in the same
                way, so it is nice to know that nobody will be left out of these
                convenient Bluetooth pairing features. The Pixel Watch is a
                promising start to Google's apparent “Hardware Renaissance”, and
                many are looking forward to seeing what will happen when Google
                is able to finally catch up and become a viable competitor in
                the ever-growing market of smart devices.</span
