                This year Apple introduced the new 10th generation iPad,
                featuring an updated design much more in line with the rest of
                the newest iPads, following the trend set by the 2018 iPad Pro
                and reinforced by the newest iPad Air and iPad Mini. The home
                button is gone and replaced by an all-screen design, and Touch
                ID is now in the power button. The Lightning port has been
                replaced with a USB-C port, making the 9th-generation iPad the
                final iPad to use Lightning connectivity.

                This iPad is also the first to put the front-facing camera on
                the landscape edge, allowing for more natural FaceTime calls as
                most users will be using this large 10.9-inch iPad in landscape
                orientation. Many find the usual camera position on the iPad to
                be strange as using the larger iPads in portrait orientation is
                considerably less common, especially when using the camera for
                video calls.

                Another interesting decision that many find confusing is the
                Apple Pencil support featured on the device. Like every other
                iPad of this generation, the latest iPad includes support for
                the Apple Pencil, promoting the device as an effective tool for
                creating artwork. This was to be expected, as the standard iPad
                has supported the Apple Pencil since the 6th generation.
                Naturally, with the flat edge design just like the other new
                iPads, users believed this iPad would support the 2nd-generation
                Apple Pencil, rather than the 1st-generation Apple Pencil used
                on the iPads featuring a Lightning port, as the older Apple
                Pencil uses the Lightning port for connectivity. Because the new
                iPads lack a Lightning port, most would expect the new iPad to
                use magnetic connectivity just like the others, as this is what
                the newer Apple Pencil uses. However, despite the lack of a
                built-in Lightning port, the only Apple Pencil supported by the
                new iPad is of the 1st-generation. The only way to use it is
                with a Lightning-to-USB-C adapter.
              </span>

                title="The 10th-generation iPad requires an adapter for use of the Apple Pencil. The iPad connects to the adapter with a USB-C to C cable."
                alt="The USB-C to Pencil adapter for the 10th-generation iPad, with a Lightning port on one side and a USB-C port on the other. The iPad connects to the adapter with a USB-C to C cable."
              /><br />
              <span class="article-text">
                Many have speculated on the reason for this, and there is a
                likely scenario which supports the reason to choose this type of
                connectivity for this iPad. When the original Apple Pencil was
                introduced, many companies purchased iPads and 1st-gen Apple
                Pencils in bulk, so that the only thing they would ever have to
                replace, if ever, would be the iPad itself, not the $100 stylus.
                However, Apple also likely recognized that most users were
                waiting for a proper update to the standard iPad line. This is
                why Apple repeatedly calls this a “completely redesigned iPad”
                despite its obvious similarities to the newer iPad Pro and iPad
                Air. This iPad is marketed towards those who have no use for
                specific subcategory iPads, and only use the one referred to as
                just “iPad.” For those users who want to upgrade but likely
                already have the older Apple Pencil, it would be considered a
                greater hassle to buy a new Apple Pencil when the old one works
                just fine. As a result, the adapter may be considered a fair
                middle ground for those who want a new iPad with a modern
                design, but don't want to buy a newer, more expensive Apple
                Pencil to go with it. For those users and businesses, this iPad
                may be the solution.
