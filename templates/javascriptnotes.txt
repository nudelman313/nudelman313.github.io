 put pubDate object in there 
make array of pubDate objects

javascript to build tagbox [DONE]

javascript function to automatically place an article in the Newest page (would likely require rewriting article box system) [DONE] [DID NOT REQUIRE REWRITING THE ARTICLE BOX SYSTEM]

javascript function for: automatically place article in month page [DONE] ; 

automatically place article in tag page 

how would a property of an object contain multiple items

	- tag property, each separated by a slash?
	- use split function to make an array when needed for a function
	- get tags from function
	
	for tag page: 
		- for loop run through array of tags on each article (*nested for loop* moment)

topics can be manual because they are easier to update
